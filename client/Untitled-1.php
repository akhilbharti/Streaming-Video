The community doesn’t want us to think for ourselves, they want us to do what they’re telling us to do rather than creating our own ideas. The world needs people who can think for themselves. We believe that those with the ability to think outside of the box will lead the future and innovate.</p>

                                 To help it grow sales,  revenues, and competitive advantages. As a business development manager, you do that by "developing" the company's offerings and opportunities. You might hold any of several job titles – for instance, business development executive, business development specialist, or chief business development officer – but it's always your responsibility to help your company secure new business in the form of brand-new clients and customers. 
                                 Part sales representative, part marketing analyst, and part business analyst, you're primarily in charge of sales and marketing, but also strategic planning, finance, and customer service. Your days, therefore, are typically very diverse. You might spend an hour brainstorming new products with a product developer, for instance, and another hour working with a market researcher on focus groups and surveys. Later that same day, you might have lunch with a new customer, meet with the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and CEO to discuss sales projections, and hear a presentation from a vendor about a new customer relationship management (CRM) tool. 
                                 Finally, you might end your day doing sales training and responding to a request for proposal (RFP) that was issued by a potential client. Essentially, then, you do a little bit of everything. Always, however, your duties as a business development executive are carried out with a singular focus: getting new business that helps your company grow.</p>

                                 An engineer in this role is expected to design, build, deploy, and manage systems from scratch. You will wear multiple hats of “architect”, ”tester” or “debugger” … everyone is expected to build systems from scratch. This means that you will need to learn, ideate and innovate on various layers across the stack… and that comes with a tremendous amount of learning
                                 - Write code that contributes to Sunfox's core products
                                 - Building state machine models with smart workflow  
                                 - Help build scalable programs that standardize information flow and increase operational capacity
                                 - Be part of a close-knit engineering team that ships new code every day.<br></p>
								 <h5 align="left">What you'll need</h5>
								 <p align="justify">
                                 - Demonstrated experience in developing scalable backend services and implementing web applications - instead of looking at your experience in number of years we dig into your past work to find indicators of a level of competency and maturity signaling somebody with 0-3 years of experience and experimentation (needless to say your work portfolio matters a lot to us)
                                 - A product-first approach to building software. You care about the real world functionality of your programming
                                 - Master of the language and platform of your own choosing. We try not to enforce language/platform selection. So whatever you know, you must know it in and out!
                                 - Experience in a fast-paced work environment & a bias for action. You ship quality code quickly.<br></p>
								 <h5 align="left">What you'll get</h5>
								 <p align="justify">
                                 - The opportunity to define the engineering culture of a small team  
                                 - Product ownership - take autonomy over core products & product features .<br></p>
								 <h5 align="left">What you are</h5>
								 <p align="justify">
                                 - Calm under pressure, have a great work ethic and communicate well
                                 - Self aware and always pushing for a higher standard. Always proactive, open to new ideas and feedback (that last part is very important as we work on rapid agile cycles so being able to process feedback is critical)
                                 - Anti fragile: with every failure you become stronger and better.
                                 - Detail oriented and absolutely intolerant to compromise or sub-optimal shortcuts
                                 - Problem solver with a global mindset
